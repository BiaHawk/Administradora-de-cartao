This file is about one university design that I made with three more people involved
It is a credit card manager
So have two trees, one for the credit cards and one for the stores
The Nodes of the credit card tree keep information of each person that make an "account" such as name of the person, card limit, card number, etc...
The Nodes of the stores keep information of each store, the same as credit card, but keep different information
